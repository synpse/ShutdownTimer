# ShutdownTimer
## Save your downloads and the planet :)

Ever wanted to download a game during the night but don't want to leave your PC on all night? 

### Features:
- Tell the program when to shutdown (in hours and minutes)
- Monitor automatically shuts down to save power and to actually let you sleep (because seriously, who can sleep when you have a second sun inside your bedroom?)
- Automatic abort upon keyboard spam (Yes, not one keypress. You have to SPAM it...)

### ATTENTION:
- This only works in Windows 7+
- No, MacOS and Linux are not supported, at least yet
- It's better if you download the source and compile the program yourself, Windows might flag it as virus
